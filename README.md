# IOT-Based-Accident-Prevention-and-Emergency-Notification-System

This project proposes an accident-avoiding system using ESP32, RF transmitter and receiver, solar panel, battery, audio playback and storage module, and Blynk app. The system is designed to be installed in a danger area, such as a school zone or construction site. When a car enters the area, the RF receiver will detect the signal from the RF transmitter and trigger the audio playback module to play a message, such as ”School ahead, go slow.” The system will also send a notification to the Blynk app, so that the user can be alerted of the car’s presence in the danger area. The ESP32 will be used to control the entire system. It will be programmed to detect the signal from the RF receiver, trigger the audio playback module, and send a notification to the Blynk app. The solar panel and battery will be used to power the system, so that it can operate autonomously. The system is designed to be easy to install and use. It can be installed anywhere in the danger area, and it does not require any wiring or other special infrastructure. The system is also very affordable, making it a viable solution for both developed and developing countries.
